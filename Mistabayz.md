Hello 

I’m a abdul major undergraduate student currently residing in Nigeria. I like to code, football and dream to travel a lot!

I work on Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a social+tech project that would help increase awareness about environmental conservation in a productive manner.


I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!
