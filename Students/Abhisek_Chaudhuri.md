# Abhisek Chaudhuri

## Whoami:
I'm a CSE Final Year undergrad, studying under the shadow of Mount Kanchenjunga, at Jalpaiguri, West Bengal.

I like to code in C++. The extensiveness of the Standard Template Library(STL) amazes me!

I am a novice competitive programmer, learning bit-by-bit (pun intended! ;) ).

I am also a web developer, full-stack. I like my websites to be pixel perfect.



## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- C/C++
- Php
- Javascript



## Frameworks and Technologies that I know:

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Boost C++
