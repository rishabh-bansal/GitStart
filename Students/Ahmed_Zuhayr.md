## About me

I am an enthusiastic developer, always in the go to learn something. I learnt basic web designing/developing skills online and by my own effort. I can/do make really good discord bots, mostly for my friends (ya i actually have friends) I'm very good with linux, #geek,

## Languages:

- PHP
- Python
- Javascript 
- Java

(Comeon, HTML is not a freaking programming language)

## Future Plans:

I'm currently on the run to learn low level OOL like C++ or C sharp, I'm almost starting out, just need to do some weird projects before I'm confident. I plan to have higher education on CSE in the future.

### That was me
