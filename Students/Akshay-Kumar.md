# Akshay Kumar

## Whoami:
I’m a CSE undergraduate student currently residing in Jaipur, India. I like to code, read, and explore new places.

I am working on Python majorly, with web development being next. Machine Learning  fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I am a newbie and want to contribute to open-source. 

I like interacting with good people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me! 



## Languages that I know:

- Python
- C/C++

## Frameworks and Technologies that I know:

- Django
