# Amr Ahmed Qasem

## Whoami:
I’m a graduate student currently I'm a project head at Clicks Egypt company, Egypt. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
