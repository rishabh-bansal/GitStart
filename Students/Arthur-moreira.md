## About me:

A 21 years old web developer who loves dealing with people. I've used HTML/CSS since neopets' userlookup and petlookup. Python fanboy.

## Frameworks and Technologies that I know:

- Python + Django
- HTML + CSS + JS
- SQL
- Java (even though i hate it)
- Google (knowing what to google is in fact the most important thing of being a dev)  

I am also a little bit familiar with spring boot + angularjs
