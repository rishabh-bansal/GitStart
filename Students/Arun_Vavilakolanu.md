## About Me
Arun is currently studying his 3rd year of Computer Science in India.
Passionate about UI/UX Design and programming, Computer science was a natural fit.
Having worked with Android, Arun wishes to explore other parts of computer science including but not limited to Web development, Programming, Machine Learning etc.
He believes in the 'Why' more than the 'How' and the 'What' and wants to live in a world where people wake up every day, inspired to go to work.
