## Whoami:
I’m a Civil engineering undergraduate student currently residing in futminna. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer
I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a social+tech project that would help increase awareness about environmental conservation in a productive manner. 

I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!
