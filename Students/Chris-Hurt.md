## Who am I?
I'm a Computer Science / Math student at CNU in Virginia, US. I enjoy coding, listening to music, and rock climbing.

The majority of my coding experience is in Java. The object orientation of the language fits very well with my style of thinking. I have started to take up Android development and enjoy the feeling of creating something new. There is a lot to learn, but it is the first thing I have found that I enjoy learning on my own, outside of the classroom.

School and work can be stressful, so I like to relax by going to small concerts and climbing on rocks. The community of rock climbers as well as coders are very accepting and it's good to be a part of something like that.

## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- Matlab
- C++
