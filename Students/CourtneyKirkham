## Who am I:
I'm a work developing web-based applications for geospatial companies.
Most of the work I do uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the addition of dojo, Esri Calcite Web, and Esri's JavaScript API.
Currently, I'm trying to get more comfortable with the idea of commiting to open source projects. Hacktoberfest seems like a good opportunit to get more comfortable with this.

## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- C++
