Hey, I'm Derek Mei. I currently work at Putnam Investments in Boston as a UX engineer. Upon graduating from BU last year with degrees in math, business administration, and computer science, I've found a happy medium working in an industry I love while combining my creative and analytical mindset with my technical expertise. My strengths lie primarily in implementing high-level design thinking across different teams, helping bridge the gap between designers and developers, and optimizing the entire user experience all the way from conception to implementation.
