## Whoami:

I work on web development majorly, with Python/Machine Learning being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. 

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I’m laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!
