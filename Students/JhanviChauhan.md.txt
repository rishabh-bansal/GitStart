## Introduction:
I’m an ICT major undergraduate student currently residing in Gujarat, India. I'm just trying to get a hang of git, GitHub and open source contribution in general.
My go to language to use is C++. With baisc knowledge of HTML/CSS, I plan on exploring web development further in the near future. I hope to actively contribute to open-source. Apart from this, I play basketball and like to read. 

## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- C/C++
