# Ludwig Guerin

## Whoami:
I study Computer Sciences in Nantes, France. I enjoy developing stuff, upgrading existing code to notice how much
I have improved my skills through time and "efforts". I prefer to work with CSS, C++, JavaScript and PHP and I really despise Python
for its poor design choices (although it is nice for beginners I guess).

I enjoy comics books, video games, music and all those boring non extravagent things. I'm currently working on a few C++11 libraries
as well as a Desktop Music Player using Vue and Electron !

That's enough for my description I guess :3 !
