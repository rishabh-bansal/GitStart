I am a second year dual degree (Bachelor's + Master's) student at IIT Bombay pursuing my academic major in Electrical 
Engineering and a minor in Center of Studies in Resources Engineering (CSRE).

Automating my existence is what I strive for. It is the sole reason for most of the coding and tinkering I do. Electronics and
Robotics are my keen interests. The rest is for helping out friends, and sometimes just for fun :).
