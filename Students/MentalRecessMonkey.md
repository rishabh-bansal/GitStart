# Akash Ravidra

## Ahoa:
I’m a Mechatronics major undergraduate student currently residing in Bangalore, India. I like to code, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Python majorly. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
