I am a junior in Computer Science at Montana State University. I'm exited about the field and am always looking for opportunities to learn more. 

So far, I know Java, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and C. I am in the process of learning Angular Dart and hope to continue to learn more. If anyone would like to give me hints or tips or any kind of help for the future, I am always open for that.
