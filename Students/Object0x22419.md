## Whoami:
I’m a CSE major undergraduate student currently residing in Mangalore, India. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future.

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
