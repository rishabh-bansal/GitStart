## About Me

I found my passion the first time I set foot in a computer lab. My love for programming has now translated to enthusiasm for software development.

I have experience developing Mobile, Web and Desktop applications. During my internship with Hasura, a Bangalore-based startup, I led a team of 4 in developing a currency conversion app.

During my ISC Board Exams, I came 1st in the Gujarat state and was featured in the Times of India, Ahmedabad Mirror and Divya Bhaskar. On top of that, I have been awarded the High Performer Award for my work during the Hasura Product Development Fellowship 2018. My article on the app we made was featured in the Exposition blog on Medium.

I face my problems head-on and donâ€™t stop till I find the best solution possible. I am able to meet deadlines while producing high-quality content. I am a team player, though I can work independently just as well. 

Outside of work, you can find me reading fantasy novels, playing racing video games or swimming.
I believe in life-long learning. To that end, I am always looking for opportunities which will challenge me and help me take my skills to the next level.
