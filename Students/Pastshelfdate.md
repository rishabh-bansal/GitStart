# Bill Lemmond

## Whoami:
Iâ€™m about to turn 60. I didn't grow up with computers. My bachelor's is in economics.  My minor in CS is only enough that I can be a client for you guys, who's not annoying.  Except that I'm also disabled, and too poor to afford you. 




## Languages and libraries that I barely know:

- HTML
- CSS
- C/C++
- Php
- JQuery
- Javascript
- React
