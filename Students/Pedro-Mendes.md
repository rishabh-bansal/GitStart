## About me:

I'm graduating at the end of 2018 at UNICAMP in Computer Engeneering course. I have participated in the CONPEC junior enterprise, AAACEC the Athletic Association of the Computer courses, I worked as a volunteer for the UNICAMP open for all event, at the computer week SECOMP and during the freshmen reception week. I acted as an assistant on the logic circuit laboratory helping the students and the teacher. My current final graduation project is related to Computational Independence and Gender Diversity, which I received a scholarship for. On march of 2018 I started an internship at CI&T and at August I was made a permanent employee. I really enjoy working in teams and Kaizen is something I live by. Continuous improvement has been around my whole life, I just didn't know there was an agile/Japanese term for it. I am studying German and I would love to get the opportunity to study more docker, java, javascript, apis and aws. 改善
