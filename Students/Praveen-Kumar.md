## About Me

People call me _Praveen_ or _PravMan_. I am an ailurophile, vegetarian, and an experimental chef. Well, I would like to experiment as much as I can, on food and my life. My body is made up of HTML & CSS, which is literally me! This defines me as a Full Stack Web Developer (Front End, Back End, Middleware, Whatever...).

Oh yeah, I am a highly motivated, passionate hard-core web developer with diverse experience in developing web applications, hybrid mobile apps, and cloud computing solutions ranging from working on cute layouts, payment gateways etcetera and the list goes on till making a clone, better than Facebook. Yup, you heard it right. I did make a clone of our favourite social network from scratch.

Once upon a time, I was consistently ranked as top 0.01% developers in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/462627). I stopped contributing much after achieving 100k reputation points. I am also a [Pluralsight Mentor](https://hackhands.com/praveen/), [Thinkful Mentor](https://www.thinkful.com/mentors/praveen-kumar-purushothaman/) and a [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001822) in the field of Visual Studio & Development Tools.
