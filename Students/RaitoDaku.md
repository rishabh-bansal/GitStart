Heyo peyo!

Raito here. I am a newbie programmer learning java. And I want to prove that age doesn't matter in coding. And to do that I 
will start working before I turn 16 aka I have 2 years to complete my goal.
I am learning in Software Development Academy which is a 6 month course in evening - 3 hours. I am going in Universities online
courses for Pascal, C++, Java. Sometimes I am asking what the hell am I doing I am only 14 and etc. But I know I will do my goal.

Languages I can make something:
* Python
* C++
* Java
* HTML, CSS, JS
* SQL
Tools I love:
*Terminal
*Vim
*Mail

I really love Linux and all that terminal stuff. My second priority is Ethical Hacking and cybersecurity. As I see in my eyes
cybersecurity and coding are the most important things in modern world.
