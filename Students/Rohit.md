Hi, I am Rohit. I am a fullstack web developer with experience in Java, Spring, Hibernate, React, Angular. Apart from these, in my free time 
I like to create games in Unity(C#). Right now I am also learning Machine Learning(which is what I am really interested in future).

I also like competitive programming. If you are interested in competitive programming, the best place to start would be hackerrank or leetcode.
Its quite addictive and an easy way to build your skills(especially before say giving an interview).

However I am new to open source. And I am planning to contribute more(not just for hacktoberfest). Also I might start some interesting projects in the
future. In case you are interested check my profile out. I hope I can learn a lot from you as well. 

Happy coding.
