# Rosenthol Curtis

## Whoami?
Iâ€™m a newby when it comes to web dev. I have attended a coding bootcamp, and took a few college courses in Computer Science, as well as a few free web tutorials.

My main discipline is Music. I have been a musician for over 20 years. My main instrument is Trumpet, but I am able to play almost any other brass instrument. I served in the United States Army as a bugler, where I was tasked to send fallen soldiers home in the most respectful manner; playing taps. 

I am excited about innovating the music industry by incorporating cutting edge technological advances.
