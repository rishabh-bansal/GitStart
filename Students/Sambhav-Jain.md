## Who am I:
I’m a CSE major undergraduate student currently residing in Delhi, India. I like to sleep. I code otherwise. 

I work on C++ majorly, with app development in Android being next. Deep Learning fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source.
I’m currently working on one of my own project which is a social+tech project that would let you order coffees within 10 seconds. 

I am a little introvert, therefore, on weekends sleep becomes my passion and my passion becomes my sleep.
