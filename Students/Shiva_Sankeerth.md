# Shiva Sankeerth

## Whoami:
I'm a IT  major undergraduate student currently residing in Hyderabad, India. I like to code, read, write, and dream to travel a lot! 

Ever since my childhood, I have been an autodidact who has been exploring the tantalizing areas of computer science with the desire to build and maintain malware-defiance systems. Going deep into any skill/technology has been my strength.

I work on Python majorly, with Machine Learning being my trade. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer.
I'm currently working on one of my own projects which is a medical+tech project that would help to classify objects viewed by our eyes using data collected from brain.
