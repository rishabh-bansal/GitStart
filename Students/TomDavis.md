## About me:
===

Been a computer geek for a long time. My first computer was a heathkit and did not have a keyboard just a three postion switch.Fixed a punch card reader at a university one time with a spring from and ink pen.
I have written small programs off and on over the years but I have always wanted to be a full time developer. So thats what I am doing and github has been a great help the people are great.
