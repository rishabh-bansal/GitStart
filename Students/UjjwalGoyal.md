## Who am I:
I’m a full stack developer, who has a keen interest in technology and has 1 yr experience as a technical analyst.

I work on Python/ Django majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence/ Data Science fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer
I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a social+tech project that would help increase awareness about environmental conservation in a productive manner.
