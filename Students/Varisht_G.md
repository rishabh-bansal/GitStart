Hi, there people. I wasn't very comfortable with pull requests so I decided to do this activity.
I'm editing this in nano so you might need word wrap on for this to look good. I'm Varisht and I have worked in the past on stuff like OpenCV, AI and machine learning using python (digit classification), face recognition.
I also did a bit of game dev using Unreal Engine (both blueprints and native C++) and using RPG Maker VX Ace. 
I like to watch anime and play games. I aspire to become a game dev. I currently work in an IT company and will soon work on mainframe projects (yeah mainframes). Thats it from my end. Hit me up on twitter at @senpaivg
