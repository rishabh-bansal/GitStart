# Yashas Reddy

## About me:

My name is Yashas Reddy and I live in India. I am student studying Engineering in Computer Science. I love computers and has a keen interest in them. Anything related to them makes me curious. Other than that I think about complex things like how the universe was created to silly things like what I am gonna eat in dinner. I am a person who loves to dream and write.

## Certificates:
- Not anything worth showing. I am more of a free learner.

## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Python
- C++
- Java

I haven't really worked on any open-source projects. Looking back, I haven't worked on any real world projects to be honest. I guess that is the reason all those open source projects on github intimidate me that much. I am hoping this is a start.

Thank You for this repo.
