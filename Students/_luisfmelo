Luís Melo

About me:

I'm 23 years old, living in Vila Nova de Famalicão (Portugal). I have a master degree in Electrical Engineering, Robotics and Automation but my passion for Software lead me to get another master degree, this time in Software Engineering. At the same time, I'm working as a Software Developer at HUUB, a technological startup that aims to connect the whole supply chain. 
In my free time, I like to read tech blogs and experiment new technological things. Additionally, I like to attend the cinema and, you can, most of the times, find me playing sports like running, swimming and biking. 

I have an extreme passion for technology and I value knowledge above all.
