I’m a CSE major undergraduate student currently residing in Jaipur, India. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot!

I work on Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a social+tech project that would help increase awareness about environmental conservation in a productive manner.
