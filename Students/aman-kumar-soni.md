## Who am i:
I’m a CSE major undergraduate student currently residing in Jalandhar, India. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer
I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a Graduation Process Trackerr project that would help graduating student in there studies as a teaching assistant and it will keep track all the record of the student. 


I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
