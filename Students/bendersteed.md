# About me

I'm just your everyday guy, hanging around in the cyberspace.

# Tech skills

I would like to be a Lisp hacker but I have lots of miles ahead of me. I've read SICP though!
Languages I'm familiar with:
- Common Lisp
- Racket
- Emacs Lisp
- Ruby
- Python

I also have a good grasp of tech like web, unix and CI.
