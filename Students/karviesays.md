#About Me
I've graduated in Philippines with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science last 2012. For few years, I stopped coding and been busy dealing with life. After all these years, I have come to a conclusion that I have to start doing something to get my dream job and to live happy. Now, I have been trying to study and practice front-end development.

#Projects
All of my sample projects is on my Codepen account. All pure HTML/CSS websites.
