# Mike Wales

I'm Michael Wales, a Full Stack Web Developer and Open Source Advocate. I live in the Chicagoland area, with my girlfriend (Daniele), and our three children (Zach, Tiara and Aiden). I enjoy all things technology related, from programming and web design to car audio and hobby electronics. When I'm not hard at work, you can usually find me settling down with a good book, catching up on my favorite TV shows, or out on the paintball field!

I'm currently the VP of Engineering for [Moonrise](https://moonrise.works) where we're transforming the way in which people find extra work shifts (for that much needed KA-CHING) and how employers find these enthusiastic and reliable workers. The adventure of building a brand new company, its culture, community, and an amazing product - with a team of executives I admire - is a once in a lifetime opportunity!

My resume is available and details my previous roles at Udacity, Department of Defense contract roles, and my enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.
