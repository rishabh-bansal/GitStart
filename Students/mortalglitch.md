Creating a profile has never been my one of my strengths as I never know what to say.

## About me
I've been developing since around 93 when my mother brought home a book for QBasic. From that book I learned basic input and output and made a little game based around Sonic the Hedgehog years later. It was only a text input adventure with a hella bad story but none the less it started my journey.

I've over the years worked across many languages. Basic, C, C++, HTML, Java, Python, PHP, and many more.

My programming has mainly been a hobby through out my life but I would eventually like to make it into a career. 

Most of what I do know is mainly random Python tools for stuff I need at the time. 

I have never made a pull request before and am starting to learn about social coding and the power of opensource.

Anyways Peace, and whatever happens, happens! You just gotta do you!
