# lane_detection

Lane detection is a well-researched area of computer vision with applications in autonomous
 vehicles,but despite the
simplicity of finding white markings on a dark road, it can be very difficult to
 determine lane  markings on various 
types of road. These difficulties  arrive  from  shadows, 
occlusion by other  vehicles, changes in the road surfaces 
itself, and differing types of lane markings.


A lane detection system  must  be able to pick out all manner of markings from cluttered roadways 
and filter them to 
produce a reliable estimate of the vehicle position and trajectory relative to the lane.
In any driving scenario, lane
lines are an essential component of indicating traffic flow and where a vehicle 
should drive.

Thus the objective of this project is to overcome these challenges and provide driver support systems.





Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-art architecture for image
 classification task. 
Whether it is facial recognition, self driving cars or object  detection, CNNs  are  being
  used  everywhere. 
While MNIST database  (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
 database) is a large database
of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image 
processing  systems. The  database is
also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine
 learning.

A CNN consists of an input and an output layer, as well as  multiple  hidden  layers. The  
hidden  layers of a 
CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers 
and normalization layers
Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the
 connectivity pattern between  neurons 
resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. 


### Thus this project tries to implement the input, output as well as various hidden layers of CNN.
