# Paolo Mangia

I'm a 24 years old guy, passionate about coding with 5 years experience in Web Design and Mobile Development. I'm always looking for the coolest and most recent programming technology to learn and use for my upcoming projects. 

Currently i'm working for an Italian startup called TIP srls as a Full Stack Developer. The startup aims at creating a payment system which is based on cryptography and high security, my task is to develop the platform and maintain it with a watchful eye on delivering the best user experience. 

When i'm not working, depending on the weather, i'm outside skating with my longboard/hanging out with friends or at home messing around with tech toys and pc components. I love travelling and i'd higly consider a working experience outside of my country(more like a dream right now).

# My goals for the future are:
