## About me:
I find the dynamic world of computers challenging as it requires people to keep on learning and pushing their limits. 
Fast-paced technological innovations continue to amaze me so much so that I would love to be part and parcel of the 
ever-evolving world of computers. Currently, I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Software Engineering, 
Specializing in both Enterprise Software Technology and Cloud Computing & Virtualization, at San Jose State University
