# Steven Torrence

## Whoami:
I am a Ruby on Rails developer who recently made the career change to computer science. 

Before being a web developer, I taught band at a high school in Dallas. I am a classically trained musician and I received my bachelors in Music Education from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. My primary instrument was bass trombone.

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching scary movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
