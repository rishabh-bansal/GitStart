# Dragan Theodora-Augustina

## About me:

I am a student at the University of Politehnica Bucharest, Romania, and this is my second year out of four (bachelor degree), studying Software Engineering and Computer Science.
I love algorithms, using and optimising them, as well as any subject that involves Unix systems and electronics. I have taken part in two courses organised by the Cisco Academy which introduced me in the world of Switching and Routing, as well as competitions such as ACM ICPC.
I would be most glad to contribute to anyone's project. Please contact me regarding anything I might be able to give a helping hand at.


## Languages that I know:

- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
I am also familiar with HTML.

My academic background also consists of a deep understanding of Physics, having participated to many competitions. Those prepared me for the thorough studying I am and always will be doing in IT and, as a hobby, science.
