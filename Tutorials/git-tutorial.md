<p>If you love text and reading just as I do at times, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials" target="blank">click here</a><br>
to check this beginner tutorial.</o>

<p>It's simple to understand and follow through as well.</p>

<p>If your way is video, whuch I prefer by the way, then you should watch<br>
Corey Schafer's beginner's guide to Git...titled: Git Tutorials for Beginners: Command-Line Fundamentals.<br>

<p>I watched the same video and I am using Git as a PRO...yipppeeee!</p>

<strong>Have fun!</strong>
