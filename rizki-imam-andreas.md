# Rizki Imam Andreas

## Who Am I:
I’m an Engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia . I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Javascript & Go majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source, and am an active sports programmer
I’m currently working on one of my own projects which is a social+tech project that would help increase awareness about environmental conservation in a productive manner. 

You can view my resume here.(in pre-alpha mode.) 

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching animation movies. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me! 

## Languages that I know:

- Go
- Php
- Javascript
