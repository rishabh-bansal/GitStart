Whoami:

I’m a CSE  undergraduate student currently studying  in IIT Mandi , India. I like to code, read, write,  dreamt to learn  a lot!

I work on C++ majorly, with web development being next.I like to contribute to open - source.

You can view my resume here.(in pre-alpha mode.)

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I’m a weirdo, laugh a lot, and seem smarter to people than I actually am!!

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!

Languages that I know:
HTML
CSS
C/C++
